From Knut Zoch: for checking differences between releases, first make sure you have the references to the release tags in your local directory (assuming atlas/athena is your ‘upstream’):
git fetch upstream --tags
git diff release/21.1.8 release/21.1.9 -- InnerDetector/InDetMonitoring/PixelMonitoring
