Tag 00-00-23
o 06 Dec, adding new packages under the umbrella of WH: BuzatuATLASUtil, BuzatuBash, BuzatuReadCxAOD. 
o 06 Dec improved checkout.sh to have a loop so that to add one package, we just have to add one line in a Python-style dictionary.
o 06 Dec renamed all folders to start with Buzatu
o Updated ./util/tag.sh (renamed from doTag.sh) to pick up automatically what was the previous tag version and add one to that. That will allow to automatically tag all the packages in BuzatuAll.
o Updated ./util/tar.sh and ./util/tag.sh to pick automatically the name of the package from the current folder, meaning I can use the same for all the packages, so that I can remove the util folder from the other packages. That way I can update just the util from BuzatuAll if I have a change to make.
o Added packages.sh that keeps the packages and the latest tags from each.
o This script is included in checkout.sh and removeUtil.sh. That way we maintain it in only one place. We remove the util folders from all packages except BuzatuAll.
